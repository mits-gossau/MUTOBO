CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TwoFactor](
	[userId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[key] [nvarchar](255) NOT NULL,
	[value] [nvarchar](255) NOT NULL,
	[confirmed] [bit] NOT NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]

<section alias="TwoFactorManagement">
    <areas>
      <area>content</area>
    </areas>
    <tab caption="Two Step Verification">
      <control>/App_Plugins/2FactorAuthentication/managementdashboard.html</control>
    </tab>
  </section>
